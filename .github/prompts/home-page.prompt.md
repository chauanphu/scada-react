Your goal is to create a new Home Page to control and monitor devices

The Homepage is consists of 4 components:
- `components/DeviceList.tsx`: Showing the list of devices (device name, device status)
- `components/DeviceDetails.tsx`: Showing detailed status of a device (on/off, auto/manual. voltage, current, power)
- `components/DeviceMap.tsx`: Map using OSM, showing the device location
- `components/ReportView.tsx`: Display energy and working reports. See `report-view.prompt.md`
